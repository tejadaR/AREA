Simple branching model, found [here](https://barro.github.io/2016/02/a-succesful-git-branching-model-considered-harmful/#figure-cactus-model)

Find the section that says: "Something More Simple". There are no need for bugfix/feature branches since it is still a small project, we can work on the master branch for the most part. However, if you want to get accustomed to it in your own branches, here are the default instructions:

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
